                entrepreneurial creation myth</span> writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded Apple in his parents’
            garage in 1976, was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in 1997, and by the time he
            died,
            in October 2011, had built it into the world’s most valuable company. Along the way he helped to transform
            seven
            industries: personal computing, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, retail stores, and digital
            publishing. He thus belongs in the pantheon of America’s great innovators, along with Thomas Edison, Henry
            Ford,
            and Walt Disney. None of these men was a saint, but long after their personalities are forgotten, history
            will
            remember how they applied imagination to technology and business.</p>

But they don’t.” Then he paused for a few moments and said, almost wistfully, “And we got some amazing things done.” Indeed, he and Apple had had a string of hits over the past dozen years that was greater than that of any other innovative company in modern times: iMac, iPod, iPod nano, iTunes Store, Apple Stores, MacBook, iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X Lion—not to mention every Pixar film. And as he battled his final illness, Jobs was surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had been inspired by him for years and a very loving wife, sister, and four children.</p>
